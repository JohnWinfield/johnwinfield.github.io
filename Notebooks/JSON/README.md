# JSON Resume Examples

This folder is dedicated to showcasing my high-level knowledge and application of interacting with JSON data.

Technologies utilized: SQL, Python, and web-dev tools (jquery, AJAX, JSON and PHP, servers, APIs)

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a human-readable text-based data exchange format that represents data objects in the context of attribute-value pairs. JSON was designed 
to be minimal, portable, and textual â€“it is generally considered to be a lightweight alternative to XML for data exchange.

You will find two folders with the following items:
  - JSON-web-dev
    - A demo of the webpage (running off localhost)
    - The 'jquery-ajax-json.php' file that is used to display the data
    - The 'getpatient.php' file that runs an SQL query against the medicaldb, and returns the result in an HTML table
    - The 'getallpateints.php' file that runs an SQL query against the medicaldb, and returns the result in JSON format
    - The [CreateMedicaldb](https://github.com/JohnWinfield/johnwinfield.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/SQL-Code/CreateMedicalDB.sql) file can be found under the SQL-Code Folder
  - [JSON-to-Python-and-JSON-to-SQL](https://github.com/JohnWinfield/johnwinfield.github.io/tree/main/Notebooks/JSON/JSON-to-Python-and-JSON-to-SQL)
    - The 'JSONtoPython' file
    - The 'JSONtoSQL' file
    - The 'bookdf.csv' file
    - The booksdb file
