## Projects

### First Published Project!

I have worked on a number of proejcts beforehand but this is my first project I am publishing to GitHub. The goal of this project was to web scrape The Onions youtube channel
and analyze the data with 2 objectives: (1) Analyze the titles of the vdieos (Natrual Language Processing) and discover (if any) the coorealtion between the number of views and 
when the video was posted. Please find the notebook [here](https://github.com/JohnWinfield/johnwinfield.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/Web%20Scraping%20The%20Onion's%20YouTube%20Channel.ipynb)
