# Data Analyst/ Data Science Portfolio portfolio by Johnny Simmons

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks that I created for data analysis or for the exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Projects

### First Published Project!

I have worked on a number of projects beforehand but this is the first project I am publishing to GitHub. The goal of this project was to web scrape The Onions youtube channel
and analyze the data with 2 objectives: (1) Analyze the titles of the videos (Natural Language Processing) and discover (if any) the correlation between the number of views and 
when the video was posted. Please find the notebook [here](https://github.com/JohnWinfield/johnwinfield.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/Web%20Scraping%20The%20Onion's%20YouTube%20Channel.ipynb)
