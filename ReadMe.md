# Data Analyst/ Data Science Portfolio portfolio by Johnny Simmons

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks that I created for data analysis or for the exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Projects

### Web Scraping The Onion's YouTube Channel

The goal of this project was to web scrape The Onions youtube channel and analyze the data with two objectives: 
  - (1) Analyze the titles of the videos (Natural Language Processing).
  - (2) Discover the correlation between the number of views and when the video was posted (Data Manipulation, & Data Visuliation). 
Please find the notebook [here](https://github.com/JohnWinfield/johnwinfield.github.io/blob/main/Notebooks/Web%20Scraping%20The%20Onion's%20YouTube%20Channel.ipynb).

### SQL Resume Examples

This folder is dedicated to displaying my advanced SQL knowledge. You will find four items:
  - (1) A (rough draft) Entity Relationship Diagram of the DB
  - (2) A (finalized) Entity Relationship Diagram of the DB
  - (3) The SQL code creating the tables and inserting values into those tables
  - (4) The SQL code that displays storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in databases.
